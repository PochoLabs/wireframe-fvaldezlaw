Labor certifications (also known as PERM applications) from the U.S. Department of Labor are not required to be filed for petitions under the first preference categories.  Immigrant visa are issued to these workers in higher priority than any of the other preference categories.  Once an immigrant visa is issued, these workers may apply for permanent legal residence in the U.S.  The three different types of workers include:</p><h4>Extraordinary Ability Individuals</h4><p>These individuals must demonstrate that they have achieved a level of sustained national or international acclaim in the field of the arts, athletics, business, education or the sciences. Successful petitions must include extensive documentation of the individual’s achievements in their field of endeavor and satisfaction of three out of ten of the criteria, which includes documentation showing national or international awards, proof of having judged the work of others, publications, media articles discussing the individual and/or their achievements, box office receipts and much more.</p><h4>Outstanding Professors or Researchers</h4><p>These individuals must demonstrate that they have outstanding achievements in their academic field with a minimum of three years of experience in academia.

Successful petitions must include extensive documentation of the individual’s achievements in their field of endeavor and satisfaction of two of the six criteria, which includes documentation showing national or international awards, proof of having judged the work of others, publications and much more. </p><h4>Managers and Executives of Multinational Businesses</h4><p>These individuals must have been employed abroad for at least one year in the past three years by the company sponsoring their immigrant visa petition.

However, labor certifications, also known as PERM applications, must first be submitted to and certified by the U.S. Department of Labor before USCIS will issue an immigrant visa, unless the labor certification requirement has been waived.</p><h4>Professionals with Advanced Degrees</h4><p>Individuals must possess an advanced degree or its equivalent (baccalaureate degree and five years of work experienced in the field) and the offer of employment must require an advanced degree.</p><h4>Exceptional Ability in the Sciences, Arts or Business</h4><p>Individuals must demonstrate that they have exceptional ability in the arts, business or science.  Successful petitions must include extensive documentation of the individual’s exceptional ability in their field of endeavor and satisfaction of at least three of the listed criteria, including ten years of experience in the field, professional certification or licensure, high remuneration, membership in professional associations, recognition for achievements, and more.</p><h4>Professionals Seeking a National Interest Waiver</h4><p>Aliens who possess an advanced degree and currently working in a field that has a substantial national interest to the U.S. may request a waiver of the labor certification (PERM application) and directly file a petition for an immigrant visa.</p><p>Qualifying for these categories requires submitting extensive documentation in addition to preparing a labor certification (PERM).

These individuals must demonstrate the following relationship to their U.S. citizen relative:</p><h3 id="m4-3">Spouses to a U.S. citizen</h3><p>Unmarried children under age 21 of a U.S. citizen; and/or</p><p>Parent(s) to a U.S. citizen child over age 21.</p><p>Please contact our office if you require assistance with this preference category.</p><h3 id="m4-4">Family-Based First Preference (F1)</h3><p>Family-based immigrant visas may receive a first preference category (F1) if the foreign relative is an unmarried son or daughter, over age 21, to a U.S. citizen parent.</p><p>Please contact FValdezLaw PC if you have any questions or want assistance with this preferene category.</p><h3 id="m4-5">Family-Based Second Preference (F2A and F2B)</h3><p>Family-based immigrant visas are assigned a second preference category (F2) if the foreign relative is related to a legal permanent resident (LPR) in the following ways:</p><p>F2A Preference: a spouse or an unmarried child under age 21 of an LPR, or</p><p>F2B Preference: an unmarried child over age 21 of an LPR.</p><p>Please contact our office if you require assistance with this preference category.</p><h3 id="m4-6">Family-Based Third Preference (F3)</h3><p>Family-based immigrant visas are assigned a third preference category (F3) if the foreign relative is a married child (of any age) of a U.S. citizen.</p><p>Please contact FValdezLaw PC if you have any questions or want assistance with this preference category.</p><h3 id="m4-7">Family-Based Fourth Preference (F4)</h3><p>Family-based immigrant visas are assigned a fourth preference category (F4) if the foreign relative is the brother or sister of a U.S. citizen and the U.S. citizen is at least age 21.</p><p>Please contact FValdezLaw PC if you have any questions or want assistance with this preference category.</p><h4 id="m4-7-1">V Visa (Visa for Spouse and Children of a Lawful Permanent Resident)</h4><p>The V visa is a nonimmigrant visa created as a result of the passage of the LIFE Act of 2000.</p><p>Spouses or children of legal permanent residents (LPRs) may apply for a V visa to allow them to come to the U.S. to live and work while they wait for an approval of their immigrant status.  The V visa requires that a Petition for Alien Relative was filed by the U.S. relative (LPR) before December 21, 2000.  Spouses or children must show that they have been waiting at least three years for action by USCIS on their petition and they have not received a visa number due to worldwide numerical limitations.</p><p>Spouses who qualify for this visa category are granted V-1 status and children are granted V-2.  The children of either spouses (V-1) or children (V-2) who qualify for this visa category are granted V-3 status.</p><p>All applicants must be eligible for visa issuance under all other applicable immigration laws. The V visa category will eventually phase out once all spouses and children who filed prior to December 21, 2000 have received a decision on their petition.</p><p>Please contact FValdezLaw PC if you have any questions or want assistance with a V-visa.</p><h4 id="m4-7-2">K-1 and K-2 Visa (Fianc&eacute;s and Minor Children)</h4><p>The K-1 visa allows the fiancé(e) of a U.S. citizen to enter the U.S. to marry the U.S. citizen as part of the U.S. immigration policy to unite families.  The marriage should take place within 90 days of the fiancé(e) entering the U.S.  Failure to marry the U.S. citizen fiancé(e) within the 90 days will prevent the foreign national from being eligible to apply for permanent residence.</p><p>Minor children belonging to the fiancé(e) may also apply for K-2 status to enter the U.S. with their parent and subsequently apply for permanent residence.</p><p>Please contact FValdezLaw PC if you have any questions or want assistance with a K-1 and a K-2 visa.</p><h4 id="m4-7-3">K-3 and K-4 Visas (Spouses and Unmarried Children) </h4><p>The new K-3 and K-4 visas are available to foreign spouses of U.S. citizens, and their unmarried children under age 21, who wish to enter the U.S. to be united with their U.S. citizen relative while their immigrant petition is pending.  The purpose of the K-3 and K-4 visas is very similar to the K-1 and K-2 visas; to allow families to be united. The difference between K-1 and K-2 from K-3 and K-4 is that a marriage has already occurred prior to the foreign spouse and children having entered the U.S.</p><p>Unlike the V visa, there is no additional K visa category that enables visa issuance for the grandchildren of the spouse or the petitioner.</p><p>Please contact FValdezLaw PC if you have any questions or want assistance with a K-3 and a K-4 visa.</p></div><div class="modal-footer"><button type="button" data-dismiss="modal" class="btn btn-default">Close</button></div></div></div></div><div id="modal5" role="dialog" class="modal fade"><div class="modal-dialog"><div class="modal-content"><div class="modal-header"><button type="button" data-dismiss="modal" class="close">&times;</button></div><div class="modal-body"><h2>Waivers</h2></div><div class="modal-footer"><button type="button" data-dismiss="modal" class="btn btn-default">Close</button></div></div></div></div><div id="modal6" role="dialog" class="modal fade"><div class="modal-dialog"><div class="modal-content"><div class="modal-header"><button type="button" data-dismiss="modal" class="close">&times;</button></div><div class="modal-body"><h2>Immigration Court/Detention</h2><ul class="modal-toc"><li><a href="#md6-1">Removal Defense</a></li><li><a href="#md6-2">Credible Fear Interview</a></li><li><a href="#md6-3">Reasonable Fear Interview</a></li><li><a href="#md6-4">Bond and Immigration Detention</a></li><li><a href="#md6-5">Asylum and Refugee</a></li><li><a href="#md6-6">Withholding of Removal</a></li><li><a href="#md6-7">Convention Against Torture</a></li><li><a href="#md6-8">Cancellation of Removal for Lawful Permanent Residents</a></li><li><a href="#md6-9">Cancellation of Removal and Adjustment of Status for Non-Lawful Permanent Residents</a></li><li><a href="#md6-10">Other Forms of Relief </a></li></ul><hr><h3 id="md6-1">Removal Defense</h3><p>Finding yourself or a family member entangled in immigration court can be one of the most stressful experiences for many immigrants.  Immigrants may encounter the immigration court system upon their initial entry to the U.S. or after many years of living in the U.S.  </p><p>FValdezLaw PC can help you and your family navigate this system.  We represent individuals in immigration court throughout Texas and Louisiana.</p><p>Please contact FValdezLaw PC if you have any questions or want assistance with an immigration court case.  </p><h3 id="md6-2">Credible Fear Interview</h3><p>When an undocumented individual enters the U.S. and is detained within 14 days of entering and within 100 miles of the U.S. border,  they will most likely be placed in a process called expedited removal.  As a result, they will be ineligible for a bond and expeditiously removed from the U.S. unless they can prove that they have a credible fear of returning to their home country. </p><p>If an individual is placed in expedited removal, it is very important that you work quickly to stop their removal from the U.S..  Individuals who demonstrate to an asylum officer that they have a credible fear will most likely be eligible to request a bond and will be able to request asylum in the U.S.  Asylum seekers must be prepared for their interview and be able to articulate their asylum claim in detail.  </p><p>Please contact FValdezLaw PC if you have any questions or want assistance with the credible fear process.  </p><h3 id="md6-3">Reasonable Fear Interview</h3><p>Immigrants who return to the U.S. after a previous deportation will most likely be ineligible to request a bond and will be removed from the U.S., unless they can demonstrate that they have a reasonable fear of returning to their home country.  If the applicant demonstrates a reasonable fear, then they will be referred to an immigration judge to determine if they are eligible for  withholding of removal or protection under the convention against torture (CAT).</p><p>If an immigrant with a prior removal order has been detained, it is extremely important to work quickly to stop their removal from the U.S.   Individuals with a reasonable fear claim must be prepared for their interview and be able to articulate their claim in detail.  </p><p>Please contact FValdezLaw PC if you have questions or want assistance with the reasonable fear process.  </p><h3 id="md6-4">Bond and Immigration Detention</h3><p>Immigrants, documented and undocumented, could find themselves in immigration detention after having contact with law enforcement or after being arrested by Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) or Immigrations and Custom Enforcement (ICE).  When an individual is detained by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the first question is if they are eligible for release on bond while their immigration court case is pending. </p><p>Every case is different. Bond eligibility depends on an individual’s immigration and criminal history (if applicable).  Some individuals will be ineligible for a bond while others will be eligible to request a bond from an immigration judge.  If you or a family member are detained by DHS, it is extremely important to work quickly to stop removal from the U.S.  </p><p>Please contact FValdezLaw PC if you have any questions or want assistance requesting a bond in immigration court.  </p><h3 id="md6-5">Asylum and Refugee</h3><p>Individuals arriving in the U.S. may apply for asylum or refugee status for temporary residence in the U.S. based on humanitarian grounds.  Individuals must demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution based on race, nationality, religion, political opinion or membership in or identification with a particular social group which would subject that individual to persecution.</p><p>Applications typically should be made within one year of arriving in the U.S.  While asylees granted temporary residence are not required to file for permanent residence within one year, refugees are required to file for permanent residence status after one year of being granted temporary status.</p><p>Work authorization is generally granted to the asylee or refugee along with temporary residence.  Spouses and children, if not already accompanying the asylee or refugee, may join at a later time.</p><p>Please contact FValdezLaw PC if you have questions about U.S. asylum or refugee laws.</p><h3 id="md6-6">Withholding of Removal</h3><p>Withholding of removal  is often an alternative to asylum for individuals who did not request asylum within one year of arriving in the U.S., who have a prior removal or other bars to asylum.  An applicant for withholding must meet a higher standard and demonstrate that it is more likely than not that they will be persecuted on account of their race, religion, national origin, membership in a particular social group or political opinion if they return to their home country. </p><p>If an applicant demonstrates their eligibility for withholding, they will not be removed and they will be eligible for a work permit.  Withholding does not allow an individual to become a lawful permanent resident.  Withholding is available to individuals in the court system who are detained and not detained.  </p><p>Please contact FValdezLaw PC if you have any questions or want assistance applying for withholding of removal.  </p><h3 id="md6-7">Convention Against Torture</h3><p>The Convention Against Torture (CAT) provides relief from removal for individuals who can show that it is more likely than not that they would be tortured by the government or with government acquiescence if removed to their home country.  Many individuals who have bars to qualifying for asylum and withholding of removal find CAT as their last option for relief.  Unlike asylum and withholding, CAT applicants do not have to show that they will be harmed on account of their race, religion, national origin, membership in a particular social group or political opinion.  </p><p>Although CAT has less bars, the applicant carries a heavy burden and is granted sparingly.   </p><p>Please contact FValdezLaw PC if you have any questions or want assistance applying for CAT.</p><h3 id="md6-8">Cancellation of Removal for Lawful Permanent Residents</h3><p>Cancellation of Removal for Lawful Permanent Residents is a defense to removal for certain lawful permanent residents.  An applicant must demonstrate they have been a lawful permanent resident for at least 5 years; they have resided continuously in the U.S. for 7 years after having been admitted in any status; they have not been convicted of an aggravated felony; they have not been granted cancellation of removal, 212(c) relief, or suspension of deportation before; they are not a terrorist, persecutor, a crewman or an exchange visitor; and they warrant the favorable exercise of discretion.    </p><p>Please contact FValdezLaw PC if you have any questions or want assistance applying for Cancellation of Removal for Lawful Permanent Residents.  </p><h3 id="md6-9">Cancellation of Removal and Adjustment of Status for Non-Lawful Permanent Residents</h3><p>Cancellation of Removal and Adjustment of Status for Non-Lawful Permanent Resident (non-LPR cancellation) is a defense to removal for certain undocumented immigrants.  An applicant for non-LPR cancellation must demonstrate that they have been physically present in the U.S. for not less than 10 years; they have been a person of good moral character for 10 years; they have not been convicted of certain crimes and they can establish that their removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to their United States Citizen or Lawful Permanent Resident spouse, parent or child.  </p><p>Please contact FValdezLaw PC if you have any questions or want assistance applying for non-LPR cancellation.   </p><h3 id="md6-10">Other Forms of Relief </h3><p>FValdezLaw PC can also assist with forms of relief such as Voluntary Departure, VAWA Cancellation of Removal, NACARA, Adjustment of Status, Waivers of Removal, Prosecutorial Discretion and others.  FValdezLaw PC will evaluate your situation, explain your options and help you make the best choice for your specific situation.  </p><p>Please contact FValdezLaw PC if you have any questions or want assistance with removal proceedings.</p></div><div class="modal-footer"><button type="button" data-dismiss="modal" class="btn btn-default">Close</button></div></div></div></div><div id="modal7" role="dialog" class="modal fade"><div class="modal-dialog"><div class="modal-content"><div class="modal-header"><button type="button" data-dismiss="modal" class="close">&times;</button></div><div class="modal-body"><h2>Executive Action</h2><ul class="modal-toc"><li><a href="#md7-1">DACA</a></li><li><a href="#md7-2">Expanded DACA</a></li><li><a href="#md7-3">DAPA</a></li></ul><hr><p>The President of the United States has executive authority to make priorities on how to enforce the U.S. immigration law.  President Obama announced two executive action programs during his presidency.  On June 15, 2012, President Obama announced Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).  On November 20, 2014, President Obama announced Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) and DACA expansion.    </p><h3 id="md7-1">DACA</h3><p>DACA has since helped hundreds of thousands of individuals acquire a work permit whileproviding protection from removal.  In order to qualify, an applicant must meet the following requirements:  Be under age 31 on June 15, 2012; have arrived in the U.S. before their 16th birthday; have continuously resided in the U.S. since June 15, 2007 up to the time of applying; have been physically present in the U.S. on June 15, 2012 and at the time of applying; had no lawful status on June 15, 2012; have graduated from high school or obtained a GED, or are currently in school or are an honorably discharged veteran of the Coast Guard or Armed Forces of the United Stated and have not been convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor or three or more misdemeanors and do not otherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety.   </p><p>Generally applicants must be 15 years old to apply.  However, individuals in removal proceedings do not have to meet that requirement.  The application process is ongoing and individuals who need to renew should do so 150 days in advance of their expiration in order to avoid a lapse in their work permit.  DACA recipients can apply for permission to travel under certain circumstances.  Applicants for travel should not leave the country until their application for advance parole has been approved.</p><p>Please contact FValdezLaw PC if you have any questions or want assistance with DACA.</p><h3 id="md7-2">Expanded DACA</h3><p>The expanded DACA program is currently on hold due to a lawsuit.  The  Supreme Court  will review the case and make a decision in June 2016.  In the meantime, it is important for potential DACA expansion applicants to educate themselves, begin collecting documents and saving their money.  </p><p>The expansion of the DACA program would allow many more individuals the opportunity to apply for DACA.  It would extend deferred action and work permits from two years to three years.  It shifts the requirement of continuously residing in the U.S. since June 15, 2007 to January 1, 2010 and it eliminates the age cap, allowing individuals who were over 31 on June 15, 2012 to apply.  Expanded DACA applicants would still have to meet all other DACA guidelines.  </p><p>Please Contact FValdezLaw PC if you have any questions or want to learn about other forms of relief. </p><h3 id="md7-3">DAPA</h3><p>The DAPA program is currently on hold due to a lawsuit.  The Supreme Court will review the case and make a decision in June 2016.  In the meantime, it is important for potential DAPA applicants to educate themselves, begin collecting their documents and saving their money.  </p><p>In order to qualify for DAPA, an applicant will have to demonstrate the following:  have lived in the U.S. continuously since January 1, 2010 and up to the time of applying; were physically present in the U.S. on November 20, 2014 and at the time of applying; had no lawful status on November 20, 2014; on November 20, 2014 had a U.S. Citizen or Lawful Permanent Resident son or daughter; and have not been convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor or three or more misdemeanors; does not otherwise pose a threat to national security and are not a priority for removal.  </p><p>Please contact FValdezLaw PC if you have any questions or want to learn about other forms of relief. </p></div><div class="modal-footer"><button type="button" data-dismiss="modal" class="btn btn-default">Close</button></div></div></div></div><div id="modal8" role="dialog" class="modal fade"><div class="modal-dialog"><div class="modal-content"><div class="modal-header"><button type="button" data-dismiss="modal" class="close">&times;</button></div><div class="modal-body"><h2>Citizenship</h2><ul class="modal-toc"><li><a href="#m8-0">Birth in the U.S. or Certain Incorporated Territories</a></li><li><a href="#m8-1">U.S. Citizenship Through One or Both Parents</a></li><li><a href="#m8-2">Naturalization</a></li></ul><hr><p>Individuals can be United States Citizens through birth in the U.S. or certain incorporated territories, citizenship of one or both parents, and through naturalization after becoming a lawful permanent resident.</p><h3 id="m8-0">Birth in the U.S. or Certain Incorporated Territories</h3><p>The Fourteenth Amendment states, “all persons born or naturalized in the United States...are citizens of the United States.”  This also includes individuals born in certain territories such as the Virgen Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Swains Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.</p><h3 id="m8-1">U.S. Citizenship Through One or Both Parents</h3><p>Some immigrants might be U.S. Citizens without even knowing it.  If one or both parents or grandparents were U.S. Citizens, it might be possible that their child is a U.S. Citizen even if they were born abroad.  Individuals may have acquired citizenship at birth or through the naturalization of their parent.
